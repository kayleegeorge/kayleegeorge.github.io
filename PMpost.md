### My Personal Advice
Before interviews, take some time to prep notes with: 
- Research on the company: some products you find cool and why (and maybe some notes about ideas on how to improve them), any cool recent news, any company-soecific technology they use (like Azure for Microsoft), etc.
- Questions to ask interviewers at the end: try to avoid basic ones that tons of other interviewees might ask.
- Answers to 'common' questions: "tell me about yourself/experiences", "what's your favorite product/why?", "tell me about a time you've had to collaborate with a team and what was your role?/how did you handle conflict?", etc.
- Anything else that might be helpful for you to remember :)

Practice interview questions. Examples:
- Estimation/Analytical: how many Ford trucks are in the Bay Area?
- Product Design: how would you design an alarm clock for the blind? _(make sure you prep a structured framework on how to approach these types of questions)_
- Behavioral: tell me about a time you failed and what you learned.
- Technical: explain recrusion to a 7-year-old.

During interviews: take time to think through questions thoughtfully, ask clarifying questions, and make sure to be communicating your thoughts with your interviewer throughout!

Use PM-y language on your resume. Some people say to make a custom resume for each role you apply to and it sounds like a good idea but I'm too lazy for that.

Be generally curious about things. Listen to podcasts to learn about new trends or phenomenons. Be critical of products you use and think about how you can improve them. It'll help you in ideation, product sense, and strategy.
