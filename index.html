	<p class = "p1">Welcome to my website (experimenting with HTML/CSS)! I am currently an undergraduate at Stanford University studying Symbolic Systems, an interdisciplinary major involving Computer Science + psychology, linguistics, and philosophy. I am passionate about education (especially CS education), sustainability, and tech x social good. I am also interested in storytelling/multimedia journalism and animal behavior. In my spare time, I'm usually cooking/baking with my mom, gardening (I love growing zucchini), playing with my dog (the cutest dog in the world I might add), or exploring the outdoors. In the future, I'd love to be a product manager! </p>
