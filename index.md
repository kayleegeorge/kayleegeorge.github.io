Howdy, I'm Kaylee.

I study Computer Science (theory) and Symbolic Systems at Stanford. I've interned at Discord (platform security), Uniswap Labs (web), Microsoft (Windows Microsoft Search, Assistant and Intelligence), Tesla (Supply Chain), and DreamBox Learning. I also spent time researching [children's development through drawings](https://twitter.com/hollyahuey/status/1552118837960638464) at the Stanford Language and Cognition Lab. 

I am interested in cryptography and building delightful product experiences. Some of my favorite classes at Stanford include: Number Theory for Cryptography ([Groth16 paper](https://kayleegeorge.github.io/math110_WIM.pdf)), a George Orwell english class, and an animal behavior class. Make of that what you will. 

I will go great lengths for good food and coffee. I believe walks help untangle thought knots and are better than buses. I think [running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_I_Talk_About_When_I_Talk_About_Running) is a good way to experience the physical human experience and [plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Change_Your_Mind) are a good way to experience dimensions of the conscious human experience. I occasionally play with [words](kleerants.substack.com).
