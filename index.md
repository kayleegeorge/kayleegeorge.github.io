I was most recently a member of technical staff at [/dev/agents](https://sdsa.ai). Before that, I worked on 
open-source crypto at [Daimo](https://github.com/daimo-eth/daimo) (self-custodial stablecoin wallet & 
seamless cross-chain payments) and at an applied cryptography residency in Osaka, Japan. 
I interned at Discord (platform security), Uniswap Labs ([Explore](https://app.uniswap.org/explore)), [Microsoft](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2iy3wn/bill_gates_jumps_over_a_chair/) (Microsoft
Search, Assistant and Intelligence), Tesla, and DreamBox Learning. I occasionally angel invest in friends like [Succinct Labs](https://www.succinct.xyz/) and Applied Compute Inc.

I studied Computer Science with a specialization in theory at [Stanford
University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF7D7fSU--U). Some of my favorite classes were number theory
for [cryptography](https://kayleegeorge.github.io/math110_WIM.pdf), [Orwellian](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/politics-and-the-english-language/)
english & history, and [animal behavior](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mind-of-an-octopus/). I also spent time researching [children's
development through drawings](https://twitter.com/hollyahuey/status/1552118837960638464) at the [Language and Cognition
Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu/index.html).

I will go great lengths for good [food](https://www.reading-f.com/magazine-f-kimchi/) and [coffee](https://www.thecoffeemovement.com/).
I ran my first marathon in April 2024 (Big Sur), danced on [Alliance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcfL6i2cgRI&t=89s) (Stanford hip-hop team),
camping and hiking (solo-ed [Kumano Kodo](https://www.tb-kumano.jp/en/kumano-kodo/) in May 2024), and [cooking](https://kleerants.substack.com/p/farmers-markets-and-forks-s2e7). I occasionally
play with [words](https://kleerants.substack.com) about slices of my life.
