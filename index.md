I'm currently a MoTS at xAI. Before that, I spent time at [/dev/agents](https://sdsa.ai) and [Daimo](https://github.com/daimo-eth/daimo).

I studied Computer Science with a specialization in theory at [Stanford
University](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF7D7fSU--U). While there, I enjoyed dancing on [Alliance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcfL6i2cgRI&t=89s), trading NFTs as part of Stanford Blockchain, cooking fresh pizzas on the farm, and scheming at TreeHacks.

I will go great lengths for good [food](https://www.reading-f.com/magazine-f-kimchi/) and [coffee](https://www.thecoffeemovement.com/). I like [long walks](https://kleerants.substack.com/p/a-long-walk-in-japan), [bread](https://kleerants.substack.com/p/part-1-bread-bash), and [fresh hierloom tomatoes](https://kleerants.substack.com/p/farmers-markets-and-forks-s2e7). I occasionally angel invest in friends like [Succinct Labs](https://www.succinct.xyz/), [Applied Compute](https://appliedcompute.com/), and [Thesis Labs](https://thesislabs.ai/).
