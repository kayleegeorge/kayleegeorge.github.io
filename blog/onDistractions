On Distractors

Prestige clouds judgement. In the words of the wise Paul Graham, prestige 'causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.' 

I've made decisions in the past that prioritize prestige over genuine curiosity. Humans are naturally drawn to prestige. 
If you don't want to be a dominant dick, social status is attained by prestige [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39223-0].

It feels easy to say “don’t let prestige cloud your pursuits.” But I think this is difficult to truly internalize. 

A mix of praise, success, and timing can make it hard to break away.
