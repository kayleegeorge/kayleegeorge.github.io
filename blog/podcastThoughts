**My Podcast Diary**

I've been getting into podcasting a lot, listening not creating (although I hope to in the future). I usually listen during drives or when I take walks.
Topics vary, it used to be crime and mystery, now they air on the side of educational or from the experts.
While it's great that I have been doing all of this learning (for that intellectual vitality), there's a lot of information and my brain is only so big.
So, I am committing to maintaining a list of podcasts I've listen to, their main takeaways, and any thoughts of my own. 
And why not spread the knowledge as part of my blog?

_Disclaimer: I listened to a bunch throughout quarantine, so this is not a complete list. This is starting August 2._

1) Is Coffee Good or Bad for You? (BrainStuff Classics)
2) Reasons to Be Cheerful (Freakonomics Radio)
3) Jonathan Zimmerman (Joe Rogan Experience)
4) Carole Hooven (Joe Rogan Experience)
5) Adam Curry (Joe Rogan Experience)
6) How Animal Domestication Works (Stuff You Should Know)
7) The fingerprints of life beyond Earth (Ted Talks Daily)
8) The infinite alchemy of storytelling | Zahra Al-Mahdi (Ted Talks Daily)
9) Yeonmi Park (Joe Rogan Experience) 
10) Spinosaurus: The Aquatic Dinosaur (Short Wave)
11) These Shoes Are Killing Me! (Freakonomics)
12) Can I Ask You a Ridiculously Personal Question? (Freakonomics)
13) Hot to Be Better at Death (Freakonomics)
14)    (Call Her Daddy)

I have listened to these a while ago, so I don't really remember:
14) The Opiod Tragedy, Part 1: "We've Addicted an Entire Generation"
15) The Opiod Tragedy, Part 2: "It's Not a Death Sentence"
