On Distractors: Prestige

Humans are naturally drawn to prestige, otherwise known as _clout_. 
From an evolutionary standpoint, social status is attained through (1) dominance or (2) prestige [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39223-0]. Assuming you don't want to be an asshole, prestige is your ticket to the top of the social heirarchy. 

The issue I have with prestige is timing. When you are young, prestige clouds judgement. In the words of the wise Paul Graham, 
prestige 'causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.' I allowed prestige to influence my ambitions at the very wrong time.
In the past, I've made decisions that prioritize prestige at the expense of exploration, genuine
curiosity, personal growth, and learning.  

When you are young, you have the luxury of exploration -- especially if you are in college. Take advantage of this unique opportunity in your life to focus on yourself, explore your cusiorities, and discover what internally excites you. Fulfilling prestige can only be attained if you are doing what you genuinely love doing. 

And don't dwell. Build cool shit. Read. Immerse yourself in communities. Be open-minded. Talk to people. It is likely that during this exploration phase, you will feel a lack of praise or prestige. If you give up because your cravings for validation are not beiing satisfied, then you are not working on the right thing. People who love what they are doing don't need prestige to keep going. 

Even if it doesn't end up amounting to anything brag-worthy, you will still have learned _something_. 

Of course, I don't want to dismiss the value of prestige. It is powerful. Academy Award winners get casted in the best movies, NYT Bestselling authors get book deals, etc. You get my point.

If your takeaway from this post is that you should always ignore what other people think, you are missing the point. It's all about timing.

It's easy to say “don’t let prestige cloud your pursuits.” It's easy to nod in agreement. But I think this is difficult to truly internalize (at least it is 
for me, maybe that's not the case with you). 

A mix of praise, success, and timing can make it hard to break away.
