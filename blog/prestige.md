### On Distractors: Prestige

If you are young, you have the luxury of exploration. Of course, exploration doesn't stop, You can always change what you're doing or learn something new. It is just easier when you are young. You aren't tied down by a family or already working at a 9-5 job. In theory, this unique time in your life allows you to survey your curiosities and discover what really excites you. But in reality, ... . These are what I call distractors. 

The first distractor I want to examine is prestige. Humans are naturally drawn to prestige, otherwise known as _clout_. 
From an evolutionary standpoint, [social status](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39223-0) is attained through (1) dominance or (2) prestige. Assuming you don't want to be an asshole, prestige is your ticket to the top of the social heirarchy. 

But prestige clouds judgement, especially when you are young. In the words of the wise Paul Graham, prestige 'causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.' I allowed prestige to influence my ambitions at a very wrong time.
I've made decisions that prioritize prestige at the expense of exploration, genuine curiosity, personal growth, and learning. 

Fulfilling prestige can only be attained if you are doing what you genuinely love doing. 

And it's easy to say “don’t let prestige cloud your pursuits.” It's easy to nod in agreement. But I think this is difficult to truly internalize (at least it is for me, maybe that's not the case with you). 

Don't dwell. Build cool shit. Read. Immerse yourself in communities. Be open-minded. Talk to people. It is likely that during this exploration phase, you will feel a lack of praise or prestige. If you give up because your cravings for validation are not beiing satisfied, then you are not working on the right thing. People who love what they are doing don't need prestige to keep going. 

Even if it doesn't end up amounting to anything brag-worthy, you will still have learned _something_. Prestige will follow if you are constantly moving forward. In order to move forward, you need to be constantly _doing_ something, _producing_ something.

Of course, I don't want to dismiss the value of prestige. It is powerful. Academy Award winners get casted in the best movies, NYT Bestselling authors get book deals, etc. You get my point.



A mix of praise, success, and timing can make it hard to break away.
