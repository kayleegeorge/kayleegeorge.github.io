On Distractors: Prestige

Humans are naturally drawn to prestige. 
After all, social status is attained through (1) dominance or (2) prestige [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39223-0]. Assuming you don't want to be an asshole,
prestige is your ticket to climb the social heirarchy. 

The issue with prestige is timing. When you are young, prestige clouds judgement. In the words of the wise Paul Graham, 
prestige 'causes you to work not on what you like, but what you'd like to like.' I allowed prestige to influence my ambitions at the very wrong time.
In the past, I've made decisions that prioritize prestige at the expense of exploration, genuine
curiosity, personal growth, and learning.  

Of course, I don't want to dismiss the value of prestige. It's a powerful force. Academy Award winners get casted in the best movies, the most cited papers
allow researchers to gain more visibility, etc. You get my point. 

It's easy to say “don’t let prestige cloud your pursuits.” It's easy to nod in agreement. But I think this is difficult to truly internalize (at least it is 
for me, maybe that's not the case with you). 

A mix of praise, success, and timing can make it hard to break away.
