## On Crypto

### Crypto Motivations

Crypto excites me for three main reasons: 

1) **Disruptive nature**: I believe that crypto will enable the age of value sharing at both the individual level and at scale. Because anyone can build and use in the space, individual empowerment and responsibility will continue to thrive, while eliminating gatekeepers. Crypto has the potential to not only disrupt the current financial paradigm, but also impact (and forge connections across) industries like gaming, cybersecurity, supply chain, etc. Crypto's innovations will facilitate widespread equity, accountability, and transparency. 

2) **Intellectual stimulation**: Crypto is a long-lasting, intellectual pursuit. It is at the intersection of fields and forces I am truly curious about. I am excited by how much I don't know and, conversely, how much I will continue to learn and explore. Some topics that currently intrigue me are balancing product and protocol, zero-knowledge (ZK), and social good incentives via tokenomics. As the space rapidly evolves with new players, cultural shifts, and technologies, I am in awe that we get to experience this unique moment in time that will propel us into the future.

3) **Alignment of values**: The crypto community empowers each other to propel innovation forward, together. I deeply believe in the vision of builders, VCs, and consumers alike: a decentralized computational infrastructure that democratizes finance (and beyond). The collaborative and optimistic enthusiasm that the crypto community has is also a very fun culture. I am extremely lucky to be involved in the crypto ecosystem at Stanford in particular, where conversations with my peers are thoroughly enjoyable, exciting, and educational.


### NFTs

This is one of the NFTs I bought during my NFT phase. Don't be like me. Despite my NFT shenanigans, I believe they are fascinating intersection of content creation, ownership, and technilogical innovation.
